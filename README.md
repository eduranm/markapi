### Common Commands

Build the development environment:

```bash
make build compose=local.yml
# or simply
make
```

Start the project:

```bash
make up
```

Stop the project:

```bash
make stop
```

To use a custom `.yml` or environment, copy `.envs` and `compose` folders, then run:

```bash
make <target> compose=your_config.yml
```

The stack uses two Docker Compose files:

* `local.yml` (development)
* `production.yml` (production)
